Gulp Subtree
============

A little gulp module to let you push a folder to a git subtree without keeping that folder in your git history. Highly recommend to use with [gulp-clean](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-clean).

# IMPORTANT!

In order for Gulp Subtree to work correctly, the folder you are pushing **MUST NOT BE IGNORED THROUGH GIT**. Often, this is the `dist` folder. This is because Gulp Subtree needs to be able to temporarly add it to your Git repository in order to push it. For this reason, it's recommended to pair with [gulp-clean](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-clean), allowing your distribution folder to be totally removed after it's been pushed.

## Requirements

`git subtree` must be previously installed. Older versions of `git` (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04's standard install version) are not bundled with it. The easiest way to check is to see if `git subtree` throws up or not. Gulp will fail silently if the command is not available. See [here](http://engineeredweb.com/blog/how-to-install-git-subtree/) for more info on how to install it.

## Usage

```js
var subtree = require('gulp-subtree');
var clean = require('gulp-clean');

gulp.task('subtree', function () {
  return gulp.src('dist')
    .pipe(subtree())
    .pipe(clean());
});
```

## Options

Options can be passed into subtree to choose the remote, branch, and message to push with. By default, it's `origin`, `gh-pages`, and `'Distribution Commit'`.
By default gulp subtree creates a temporary commit to pick up any generated files.  Use the skipCommit flag if you wish to skip this.

```js
var subtree = require('gulp-subtree');
var clean = require('gulp-clean');

gulp.task('subtree', function () {
  return gulp.src('dist')
    .pipe(subtree({
      remote: 'upstream',
      branch: 'master',
      message: 'Here We Go!',
      skipCommit: false
    }))
    .pipe(clean());
});
```
